\section{Chapter One}
\subsection{De Morgan's Law}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(A \cup B)'=A' \cap B'$
\item $(A \cap B)'=A' \cup B'$
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Cartesian Product}
$$A \times B = {(a,b): a\in A, b\in B}$$

\subsubsection{Relations}
\text{Subsets of the Cartesian Product are called relations.}

\subsubsection{Functions (Mapping)}
$$f\subset A \times B$$
\text{Function is a special type of relation where} \textbf{each element $a\in A$ has a unique element $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in f$}.
\text{The set $A$ is the domain of $f$ and $f(A)$ is the image/range.}
\paragraph{Surjective (Onto)}
\subparagraph{if there exists an $a\in A$ for each $b\in B$ such that $f(a)=b$; for each $b\in B$ there is at least one corresponding $a\in A$}
\paragraph{Injective (One-to-one)}
\subparagraph{if $f(a_1)=f(a_2)$ implies $a_1=a_2$; for each $b\in B$ there is at most one corresponding $a\in A$}
\paragraph{Bijective} a map that is both surjective and injective

\subsection{Composition Theorem}
$$(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item The composition of msppings is associative.
        $$(h\circ g)\circ f=h\circ (g\circ f)$$
    \item If $f$ and $g$ are both one-to-one, the mapping $g\circ f$ is one-to-one.
    \item If $f$ and $g$ are both onto, the mapping $g\circ f$ is onto.
    \item If $f$ and $g$ are bijective, the mapping $g\circ f$ is bijective.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identity Mapping}
for any set $S$ \\
notation: $id$ or $id_S$; \\$id(s)=s \;\forall s\in S$
\subsubsection{Inverse Mapping}
for $f: A\rightarrow B$:\\
$g: B\rightarrow A$ is the inverse mapping of it\\
$$g\circ f=id_A; f\circ g=id_B$$
A map is said to be invertible if it has an inverse.

\subsection{Equivalence Relations}
For a set $X$, a relation $R\subset X\times X$ that is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reflexive: $(x,x)\in R \;\forall x\in X$
    \item symmetric: $(x,y)\in R$ implies $ (y,x)\in R$
    \item transitive: $(x,y)\in R, (y,z)\in R$ impiles $(x,z)\in R$
\end{itemize}
The relation is said to be an equivalence relation, written as $x\sim y$.

\subsection{Partition}
a partition of a set $X$ is a collection of nonempty sets $X_1, X_2,...$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X_i \cap X_j = \emptyset$ for $i\neq j$
    \item $\bigcup_i X_i=X$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Equivalence Class}
$$[x]=\{y\in X: x\sim y\}$$

\begin{itemize}
    \item $a,b,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}$
    \item $0\leq r<b$
\end{itemize}
If $b=ak$ for some integers $k$, we write $a|b$
\subsubsection{Common Divisor}
an integer $d$ is a common divisor if $d|a$ and $d|b$
\subsubsection{Greatest Common Divisor}
a positive integer $d$ such that $d$ is a common divisor of integers $a$ and $b$; for any other common divisors $d'$ of $a$ and $b$, $d'|d$\\\\
notation: $d=gcd(a,b)$\\
$gcd(a,b)=ar+bs$ for some integers $r,s$\\

\textbf{Relatively Prime}: integers $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if $gcd(a,b)=1$\\

    \item $\mathrm{Z}_n=\{[0],[1],[2],...,[n-1]\}$ as a set of equivalence classes where arithmetic is $mod_n$
    \item $a\equiv b(mod \: n)$ if $n|a-b$
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Symmetry}
\subsection{Definitions and Examples}
\subsubsection{Group}
A group $(G,\circ)$ is a set $G$ together with a law of composition $\circ$ that satisfies the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the law of composition is associative: 
    $(a\circ b)\circ c=a\circ (b\circ c)$ for $a,b,c\in G$
    \item there exists an element $e\in G$ as the identity element, such that for any element $a\in G$, $e\circ a=a\circ e=a$
    \item for each element $a\in G$, there exists an inverse element in $G$ denoted by $a^{-1}\in G$ such that $a\circ a^{-1}=a^{-1}\circ a=e$
\end{itemize}
A group is said to be \textbf{abelian} if $a\circ b=b\circ a \;\forall a,b\in G$, or else being \textbf{nonabelian}.
\\Laws of Exponents [$\forall g,h\in G$]\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item $g^{m}g^{n}=g^{m+n}\;\forall m,n\in \mathbb{Z}$
    \item $(g^m)^n=g^{mn}\;\forall m,n\in \mathbb{Z}$
    \item $(gh)^n=(h^{-1}g^{-1})^{-n}\;\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}$
    \item if $G$ is abelian, $(gh)^n=g^{n}h^{n}\;\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Subgroup}
A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ needs to be
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a subset $H$ of $G$
    \item the group operation of $G$ is restricted to $H$
    \item $H$ itself is a group (meet the conditions)
\end{enumerate}
Every group with at least two elements will always have at least two subgroups: the subgroups with only the identity element and the entire group itself.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trivial Subgroup:} $H=\{e\}$
    \item \textbf{Proper Subgroup:} a subgroup that is a proper subset
\end{itemize}

-\\A subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The identity $e$ of $G$ is in $H$.
    \item If $h_1,h_2\in H$, then $h_1 h_2\in H$.
    \item If $h\in H$, then $h^{-1}\in H$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter Four}
\subsection{Cyclic Subgroups}
Let $G$ be a group and $a$ be any element in $G$. Then the set $<a>=\{a^{n}: n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a subgroup of $G$. \\
Furthermore, $<a>$ is the smallest subgroup of that contains $a$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $a\in G$, we call $<a>$ the \textbf{cyclic subgroup} generated by $a$.
    \item If $G$ contains some element $a$ such that $G=<a>$, then $G$ is a \textbf{cyclic group}. In this case, $\mathbf{a}$ \textbf{is a generator of }$\mathbf{G}$.
    \item If $a$ is an element of a group $G$, we define the \textbf{order} of $a$ to be the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n=e$, and we write $|a|=n$. If there is no such integer $n$, we say that the order of $a$ is infinite and write $|a|=\infty$ to denote the order of $a$.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Theorems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every cyclic group is abelian.
    \item Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
    \item The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ are exactly $n\mathbb{Z}$ for $n=0,1,2,3,...$.
    \item Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ and suppose that $a$ is a generator for $G$. Then $a^{k}=e$ if and only if $n$ divides $k$.
    \item Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ and suppose that $a$ is a generator of the group. If $b=a^k$, then the order of $b$ is $n/d$, where $d=gcd(k, n)$.
    \item Generators of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are the integers $r$ such that $1\leq r<n$ and $gcd(n, r)=1$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter Five}
\subsection{Definitions \& Notation}
\textbf{Theorem:} The \textbf{symmetric group} on $n$ letters, $S_n$, is a group with $n!$ elements, where the binary operation is the composition of maps.
\\\\\\\\
\subsubsection{Cycle Notation}
A permutation $\sigma \in S_X$ is a \textbf{cycle of length} $k$ if there exists elements $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k \in X$ such that
$$\sigma(a_1)=a_2$$
$$\sigma(a_2)=a_3$$
$$...$$
$$\sigma(a_k)=a_1$$
and $\sigma(x)=x$ for all other $x\in X$. We write $(a_1 a_2 a_3 ... a_k)$ to denote the cycle $\sigma$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A subgroup of $S_n$ is called a permutation group.
    \item Two cycles in $S_n$, $\sigma=(a_1 a_2 ... a_k)$ and $\tau=(b_1 b_2 ... b_l)$ are disjoint if $a_i \neq b_i$ for all $i$ and $j$.
    \item Let $\sigma$ and $\tau$ be two disjoint cycles in $S_n$. Then $\sigma\tau=\tau\sigma$.
    \item Every permutation in $S_n$ can be written as the product of disjoint cycles. 
    \item A cycle of length 2 is a \textbf{transportation}.
    \item If the identity $id$ is written as the product of $r$ transpositions, then $r$ is an even number.
    \item If a permutation $\sigma$ can be expressed as the product of an even numer of transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling must also contain an even number of transpositions.
    \item The set of even permutations $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$. The order is exactly half of it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dihedral Groups}
For $n=3,4,...$, we define the $n$th dihedral group to be the group of rigid motions of a regular $n-gon$. \\
\textbf{Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dihedral group, $D_n$, is a subgroup of $S_n$ of order $2n$. ($n$ choices of rotations and 2 choices of reflections)
    \item The group $D_n$, $n\geq 3$, consists of all products of the two elements $r$ and $s$, where $r$ has order $n$ and $s$ has order $2$, and these two elements satisfy the relation $srs=r^{-1}$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter Six}
\subsection{Cosets}
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. \\
Define a \textbf{left coset} of with representative $g\in G$ to be the set $gH=\{gh: h\in H\}$.\\
Define a \textbf{right coset} of with representative $g\in G$ to be the set $Hg=\{hg: h\in H\}$.\\
Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$ and suppose that $g_1,g_2\in G$. The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $g_{1}H=g_{2}H$
    \item $Hg^{-1}_{1}=Hg^{-1}_{2}$
    \item $g_{1}H\subset g_{2}H$
    \item $g_{2}\in g_{1}H$
    \item $g_{1}^{-1}g_{2}\in H$
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Theorem}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. Then the left cosets of $H$ in $G$ partition $G$. That is, the group $G$ is the disjoint union of the left cosets of $H$ in $G$.
\textbf{Theorem}
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Define the \textbf{index} of $H$ in $G$ to be the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. We will denote the index by $[G:H]$.\\
example: $[\mathbb{Z}:3\mathbb{Z}]=3$\\
\textbf{Theorem}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of group $G$, The number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is the same as the number of right cosets of $H$ in $G$.

\subsection{Lagrange's Theorem}
\textbf{Theorem}
Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $|G|/|H|=[G:H]$ is the number of distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$. In particular, the number of elements in $H$ must divide the number of elements in $G$.
\subsection{Fermat's and Euler's Theorems}
\subsubsection{Euler $\phi$-function}
The Euler $\phi$-function is the map $\phi$: $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined by $\phi(1)=1$, and, for $n>1$, $\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integers $m$ with $1\leq m<n$ and $gcd(m,n)=1$.
$$\phi(30)=\phi(2\times 3\times 5)=30-\frac{30}{2}-\frac{30}{3}-\frac{30}{5}+\frac{30}{6}+\frac{30}{10}+\frac{30}{15}-\frac{30}{30}=8$$
\subsubsection{Euler's Theorem}
\textbf{Theorem}
Let $U(n)$ be the group of units in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Then $|U(n)|=\phi(n)$.\\
\textbf{Theorem}
Let $a$ and $n$ be integers such that $n>0$ and $gcd(a,n)=1$. Then $a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1$ mod $n$.
